<h2>ABOUT MATRIMONIAL JOKES, AND ONE IN PARTICULAR</h2>

<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/i_006.png" alt="O" width="20%" />
<span class="hide">O</span>f all Mr. Punch's jokes it might be fair to say that none has ever
rivalled the popularity of "Advice to persons about to marry,&mdash;Don't!"
unless it be that of the Scotsman who had been no more than a few hours
in London, "when bang went saxpence!" Of the latter, more in its place;
here, we are immediately concerned with "Punch's advice". The most
preposterous stories are current among the uninformed as to the origin
of some of Mr. Punch's favourite jests. Only recently we heard a
gentleman telling a group of people in a hotel smoking-room that Mark
Twain got a hundred pounds from Punch for writing that famous line, "I
used your soap two years ago; since then I have used no other," familiar
to every one by Mr. Harry Furniss's drawing of a disreputable tramp who
is supposed to be writing the words quoted. As a matter of fact, the
idea came to Mr. Furniss from an anonymous correspondent. Stories
equally, if not more, absurd have been told as to the origin of "Punch's
advice," which, thanks to the researches of Mr. Spielmann, we now know
to have been the happy inspiration of Henry Mayhew, one of the founders
of <i>Punch</i>. It was sixty-one years ago that Mayhew wrote the line, and
how many millions of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> times it must have been quoted since one dare not
guess!</p>

<p>It may be said to have struck the keynote of Mr. Punch's matrimonial
policy, as an examination of his pages reveals him an incorrigible
pessimist on the subject of marriage. He is very hard on the
mother-in-law, but in all his life he has not made more than one or two
jokes about the young wife's pastry, though he has made a good deal of
fun about her general ignorance of domestic affairs. Nor has he spared
the bachelor or the old maid, and the designing widow has been an
especial butt for his shafts.</p>

<p>It might be a good thing to pass a law prohibiting young and
marriageable men from reading <i>Punch</i>, in order to save many of them
from being discouraged and frightened out of the thought of marriage,
and it would certainly be an incentive thereto&mdash;they would be tempted to
become Benedicts if only that they might qualify for the removal of the
prohibition!</p>

<p>My dear Ethel,&mdash;You ask me what "sort of a husband" I recommend. My

dentist, and I can tell you precisely. I can name the man. But what sort

<p>You will find him very useful if managed judiciously; he will prove an

porters, and squabble with cabmen. Then from a certain view I should
advise some of those "about to marry" to select a man who has no club.
But this is an exceptional case. Finally, if you wish to be strictly
economical, and to live in the suburbs, or in the country, and if your
husband has no occupation or profession, then I should say, in order
that you may attend assiduously to your domestic duties, which include

<h2>LOVE LETTERS OF A BUSINESS MAN.</h2>

<p>The course of true love, though beset with almost insurmountable
obstacles, often rewards the faithful lovers at the last with supreme
happiness. But, alas! sometimes the said true love proves naught but a
toboggan-slide leading to a precipice, into which the true lovers' hopes
are hurled and dashed into atomic smithereens.</p>

<p>We have before us a volume of a "Business Man's Love Letters," a few
extracts from which we give below. Reader, if you have a tear, prepare
to shed it now! The burning passion which surges in the lover's heart,
though embodied in phrases habitually used by a business man, is sure to
touch your soul. But presently comes the pathetic ending, when she is no
longer anything to him, and he&mdash;to use the imperfect but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
comprehensive vernacular&mdash;is to her as "dead as a door nail." Reader,
read on!</p>

<h2>PROFESSIONAL LOVE-LETTERS</h2>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="center"><i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Norman Dormer</span>, <i>Architect and Surveyor, to</i> <span class="smcap">Miss Caroline
Tower</span>.</p>

<p>
<span class="smcap">My Precious</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>Pity me who must stay and fret in London, while you are enjoying
yourself at Broadstairs. How I long to be there, surveying the ocean by
your side, and tracing your dear name on the sands! But fate and a
father have placed a barrier between us. So I pace up and down before
the old house in T&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;Square, and look up at a certain dormitory on the
second story&mdash;in no state of elevation you may be sure&mdash;and make plans
for the future, and build castles in the air, and try to forget that my
designs on your heart appear ridiculous to your papa, whose estimate of
me I am aware is not in excess. For can I forget what he said that wet
Saturday afternoon in the back drawing-room, when I tendered myself to
him as a son-in-law, and the tender was not accepted? After telling him
that it was the summit, the pinnacle of my ambition to win you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
as my wife, did he not answer that he considered I ought not to aspire
to your hand until the statement of my pecuniary means (as he worded it)
was more satisfactory, and, meanwhile, requested me to discontinue my
pointed attentions? Never until <i>you</i> bid me. Only be firm, and the
difficulties now in our way will but serve to cement us more closely
together; only be true and I will wait patiently for that day which
shall put the coping-stone to my happiness. I build upon every word,
every look, every smile I can call to mind. You <i>will</i> write and assure
me there is no foundation for the report of another and more fortunate
competitor, but that I still fill the same niche in your affections I
ever did? For, Caroline, were I to hear you were an "engaged" Tower, I
could not survive the blow. I should stab myself with my compasses in
the back office.</p>

<p>But away with such gloomy fears. Let me picture her to myself. How plumb
she stands! How arch she looks! What a beam in her eye! What a graceful
curve in her neck! What an exquisitely chiselled nose! What a brick of a
girl altogether! I must stop in my specification,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
or you will think there is something wrong in my upper story, and not
give credence to a word I say.</p>

<p>I have just been calling on your sister, and saw your little pet Poppy,
who talked in her pretty <i>Early English</i> about "Tant Tarry." Aunt Sarah
was there, staying the day, looking as mediæval as ever, and with her
hair dressed in the usual Decorated style. She hinted that you were
imperious, and that any man who married you must make up his mind (grim
joke) to fetch and Carry at your bidding. And then you were so
ambitious! The wiseacre! why, I will leave no stone unturned to get on
in my profession if you will only be constant. I will be the architect
of my own fortunes&mdash;your love the keystone of my prosperity. The columns
of every newspaper shall record my success; every capital in Europe
shall know my name. She did not unhinge me a bit, and the shafts of her
ridicule fell harmless; although, she made an allusion to "dumpy" men,
which I knew was levelled at me, and sneered at married life as very
pretty for a time, but the stucco soon fell off. Poor Aunt Sarah! I left
her sitting up quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
perpendicular with that everlasting work which she is always
herring-boning. And now, Carry, darling&mdash;oh, dear! I am wanted about
something in our designs for the new Law Courts, and have only time to
sign myself,</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p class="center">
<i>From</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. Alfred Pye</span>, <i>Professed Man Cook, to</i><br />
<span class="smcap">Miss Martha Browning</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>What a stew I was in all Friday, when no letter came from my Patty!
Everything went wrong. I made a hash of one of my <i>entrées</i>, and the
<i>chef</i>, who guessed the cause of my confusion, roasted me so that at
last I boiled over, and gave him rather a tart answer, for, as you know,
I am at times a little too peppery. Thy sweet note, when it <i>did</i>
arrive, made all right. I believe I was quite foolish, and went capering
about with delight. And then I cooled down, and composed a new
<i>soufflé</i>. So you see I do not fritter away <i>all</i> my time, whatever
those malicious people who are so ready to carp at me may think.</p>

<p>You say you always like to know where I go in an evening. Well, I went
to the Trotters last night, and Fanny played the accompaniment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> I
sang&mdash;how it made me think of you!&mdash;"<i>Good-bye, Sweetbread, good-bye!</i>"
(How absurd! Do you see what I have written instead of "<i>Sweetheart</i>"?
All the force of habit. It will remind you of that night at Cookham,
when we were the top couple in the supper quadrille, and I shouted,
"Now, Side-dishes, begin!" and everybody roared except a certain young
lady, who looked a trifle vexed. Don't you remember that Spring? You
must, because the young potatoes were so small.)</p>

<p>Your <i>protégé</i>, Peter, goes on famously. He's a broth of a boy, not a
pickle, like many lads of his age, and yet he won't stand being sauced,
as he calls it. He and I nearly got parted at the station, for the crowd
was very great after the races&mdash;in fact, a regular jam. It rained hard
when we reached Sandwich, and I got dripping wet, for I had forgotten my
waterproof, and there was not a cab to be had. But now the weather has
changed again, and we are half baked. A broiling sun and not a puff of
wind.</p>

<p>There was no one in the train I knew. Some small fry stuffing buns all
the way, and opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> me a girl who had her hair crimped just like
yours, and wore exactly the same sort of scalloped jacket. A raw young
man with her, evidently quite spooney; and they larded their talk with
rather too many "loves" and "dears" for my taste, for you know <i>we</i> are
never tender in public. It grated <i>so</i> on my ear, that at last I made
some harmless joke to try and stop it, but mademoiselle, who spoke in
that mincing way you detest, turtled up, so I held my tongue all the
rest of the way, and amused myself with looking at your <i>carte</i>, and
concocting one of my own for our great dinner on the 29th, for the
<i>chef</i> has gone to Spithead, and left all to me. And now, my duck, not
to mince matters, when I have got that off my mind (if the dinner is
only as well dressed as you, it will do), you must fix the day. I am
quite unsettled. I cannot concentrate my thoughts on my gravies as I
ought, and my desserts are anything but meritorious. All your fault,
miss. You are as slippery as an eel. I must have it all arranged when I
come up to the City next week. I have some business in the Poultry, but
shall slip away as soon as I can, and bring your mother the potted
grouse and chutney. ("Cunning man," I hear you say, "he wants to curry
favour with mamma.") And you will do what I ask? Where shall we go for
our wedding trip?&mdash;Strasbourg, Turkey, Cayenne, Westphalia,
Worcestershire? Perhaps, I think most of coming back to the little house
which I know somebody will always keep in apple-pie order, and of covers
for two; and I shall admire the pretty filbert-nails while she peels my
nuts, and we will both give up our flirtations, mere <i>entremets</i>, and
sit down soberly to enjoy that substantial <i>pièce de
résistance</i>&mdash;Matrimony. Do you like the <i>menu</i>? Then, my lamb, say "yes"
to</p>

<p class="regards">Your own</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Alfred</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I know my temper is rather short, but then think of my crust! And
it speaks well for me that I would rather be roasted fifty times than
buttered once. I <i>do</i> hate flummery, certainly.</p>

<h3>THE SEVEN WONDERS OF A MARRIED MAN.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Not</span> going to sleep after dinner!</p>

<p>2. Never going anywhere in the evening, excepting "to the club!"</p>

<p>3. Always being good-tempered over the loss of a
button, and never wreaking his vengeance on the coals
if the dinner isn't ready exactly to a minute!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>
<p>4. Never finding fault with his "dear little wifey," if
she happens to be his partner at whist.</p>

<p>5. Not "wondering," regularly every week, "how the money goes!"</p>

<p>6. Resigning himself cheerfully, when asked to
accompany his wife on "a little shopping!"</p>

<p>7. Insisting upon the servants sitting up, sooner
than take the latchkey with him!!!</p>

<h3>THE SEVEN WONDERS OF A MARRIED WOMAN.</h3>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Never</span> having "a gown to put on," when
invited out anywhere.</p>

<p>2. Always being down the first to breakfast! always
being dressed in time for dinner! and never keeping
the carriage (or the cab) waiting at the door a minute!</p>

<p>3. Not always having "delicate health," about the autumn, and being
recommended by her medical man "change of air" immediately!</p>

<p>4. Keeping up her "playing and singing" the same
after marriage as before!</p>

<p>5. Giving her husband the best cup of tea!</p>

<p>6. Never making the house uncomfortable by continually
"putting it to rights!"&mdash;nor filling it choke-full
with a number of things it does not want, simply because
they are "bargains!"</p>

<p>7. Never alluding, under the strongest provocation,
to "the complete sacrifice she has made of herself!"&mdash;nor
regretting the "two or three good offers," which
she (in common with every married woman) had before
she was foolish enough to accept <i>him</i>!!&mdash;and never,
by any accident, calling her husband "a brute!"</p>

<h2>HOW TO MAKE LIFE EMINENTLY DISAGREEABLE</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By a strong-minded Married Woman</i>)</p>

<p>Always provide for everything beforehand. As things are sure to turn out
differently from what you have arranged, this will familiarise you with
disappointment.</p>

<p>Always go back upon a mistake or a misfortune, and so take the
opportunity of proving how much better things would have been if
something had been done that hasn't.</p>

<p>Never give way in trifles, as there is no saying how soon you may be
called upon to give way in matters of more importance.</p>

<p>A mistress may talk <i>at</i> her servants, but should never lower herself so
far as to talk <i>to</i> them.</p>

<p>Never dress for your husband, which will teach him to value you for your
gifts of mind, not your attractions of person.</p>

<p>Never give expression to your affections, as there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> is no saying how
soon they may alter, and you may thus be guilty of great inconsistency.</p>

<p>Never consult the taste of your husband, or he will in time come to look
on his house as a club, where all is comfort and self-indulgence.</p>

your naturally dark hair is due to the excellent preparation recommended
in another column, and he tells you he does not admire dark girls, why
not keep on? The bottles are really quite cheap at nineteen and eleven.
Of course, if it weighs upon your conscience, you might give him a hint,
but he will probably talk about deceit, and behave in the brutally
outspoken male manner so many readers complain of.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amelia.</span>&mdash;Have you not been rather indiscreet? You should never let him

<p><span class="smcap">Blanche Amory.</span>&mdash;Cheer up. As you very cleverly put it, history does
repeat itself. You are now once more in a position to undertake a
further instalment of <i>Mes Larmes</i>. No. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> are overstocked with poetry.
The man, of course, is beneath contempt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two Strings.</span>&mdash;Your <i>fiancé</i> must be a perfect <i>Othello</i>. It is, as you
justly remark, monstrous that he should object to your cousin seven
times removed taking you to the theatre once or twice a week. Of course
he is a relative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sweet-and-Twenty.</span>&mdash;Your remarks about tastes in common are perfectly
correct. So long as you both collect postcards you will always be able
to give pleasure to each other at a distance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Business Girl.</span>&mdash;If you have found out that he only gave twenty-five
pounds for your engagement ring, it may be, as you shrewdly observe,
that he has a contract with the tradesman for a periodical supply of
such articles. The fact that his income is under a hundred a year makes
it only the more probable that he would adopt such an arrangement for
economy's sake. Be very careful.</p>

<h3>READING BETWEEN THE MARRIAGE LINES</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Recent Victim</i>)</p>

<p>One of the first troubles to be faced by the young wife is the
difficulty of getting servants. It will be found that a cook is almost
indispensable. Rather than be without one, take time by the forelock
and, during the engagement, try the following advertisement (one is
bound to offer additional attractions nowadays):&mdash;"Wanted, at once, a
good plain cook. If necessary, <i>advertiser would be willing to make her
a bridesmaid</i>. Must be able to wear blue."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Or again:&mdash;"Newly married couple require cook and parlour maid. <i>All
china, glass, &amp;c., in house new and unused and never been broken
before.</i>"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>In taking a house, remember that it is absolutely necessary to have an
attic&mdash;in which to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> place some of the presents. It is all very well to
say that they can be put in the servants' hall, but it must not be
forgotten that it is now very difficult to keep servants, even under the
most favourable circumstances.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>You cannot be too careful in giving instructions for your house
decoration. "In the dining-room I think I would like a dado," I said one
day to the paper-man. The paper-man's face turned almost white at the
suggestion. "You cannot, sir," he said in a hushed voice, "<i>the dado is
extinct</i>." Then he explained that persons of taste have friezes
nowadays, both in summer and winter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>To avoid a rush at the end, it will be worth the bride's while to write
out beforehand a large number of letters of thanks for wedding-presents.
The most handy form is, "<span class="smcap">Dear</span>&mdash;&mdash;, We both thank you so very much for
your&mdash;&mdash; present." When the present arrives you can fill in the missing
word as circumstances require. On no account leave the blank.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Another happy form is, "<span class="smcap">Dear</span>&mdash;&mdash;, Thank you so much for your charming
and useful present. Please, what is it for?"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>But beware of the following form, as some persons do not take it in the
way in which it is meant, "<span class="smcap">Dear</span>&mdash;&mdash;, Many thanks for your present. It is
very good of you to have sent anything."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Nothing looks so solidly generous in the list of presents as the vague
word, Cheque. Many mean people now send as a present a cheque for
ten-and-six.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>A novelty at wedding-receptions, and very <i>chic</i>, is to have in the
present-room, in place of a detective, a parrot which has been trained
to cry out every now and then, "Put that back! Put that back!"</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Another novelty is to have a stall for the sale of duplicate articles.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The custom by which the bridegroom, on the night before the wedding,
gives a farewell dinner to his bachelor friends is falling into
desuetude. As a consequence one sees less frequently the
announcement:&mdash;"On the &mdash;&mdash; instant, by the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, <i>assisted by</i>
the Rev. Mr. &mdash;&mdash;, &amp;c."</p>

<h2>AN ENGAGEMENT</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>A Page from a Diary</i>)</p>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Delightful news! My sister Nellie is engaged to be married!
It came upon us all as a great surprise. I never had the slightest
suspicion that Nellie cared twopence about old Goodbody St. Leger. He is
such a staid, solemn old party, a regular fossilised bachelor we all
thought. Not at all the sort of man to give way to emotions or to be in
love. However, it's a capital match for Nellie as St. Leger's firm are
about the largest accountants in the city. My wife thinks it will be a
good thing in another way, too, as my other six sisters may now have a
chance of going off. It seems that when once this kind of epidemic gets
into a family, all the unmarried sisters go popping off like blazes one
after another. Called with my wife this afternoon to congratulate
Nellie. Rather a trial for the poor girl, as all sorts of female
relatives had called full of enthusiasm and congratulations. Goodbody
was there (Nellie calls him "Goodie") and seemed rather overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>He went away early and didn't kiss Nellie. I thought this funny, and
chaffed Nellie about it afterwards. She said she'd soon make that all
right.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Goodbody is getting on. We had a family dinner at home
to-night. He came rather late and entered the drawing-room with an air
of great determination, marched straight up to Nellie and kissed her
violently. It was splendidly done and we all felt inclined to cheer. He
kissed her again when he went away, and lingered so long in saying
good-night to my mother that we all thought he was going to kiss her
too. But he didn't. My wife said that the suspense of those moments was
dreadful.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;He has kissed my mother&mdash;on both cheeks. I must say the
old lady took it extraordinarily well, though she was not in the very
least prepared for it. It happened at five o'clock tea, in an interval
of complete silence, and those two sounding smacks simply reverberated
through the room. Mother was quite cheerful afterwards, and spoke to
Nellie about the trousseau in her usual calm and collected frame of
mind. Still I can see that the incident has made a deep impression upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
her. My wife told Maggie it would be her turn next.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;It <i>has</i> been Maggie's turn. Goodbody called at home on his
way from the City, and set to work as soon as he got into the
drawing-room. He first kissed Nellie, then repeated the performance with
my poor mother, and, finding that Maggie was close behind him, he kissed
her on the forehead. Where will this end?</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;He has regularly broken loose. He dined at home to-day, and,
without a word of warning, kissed the whole family&mdash;my mother, Nellie,
Maggie, Alice, Mabel, Polly, Maud, and little Beta. He quite forgot he
had begun with my mother, and, after he had kissed Beta, got confused,
and began all over again. At this moment my wife and I came in with Aunt
Catherine, whom we had brought in our carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> Both my wife and Aunt
Catherine tried to escape, but it was no good. He kissed them both, and
was just advancing towards me, when the butler fortunately announced
dinner. Matters are getting quite desperate, and we none of us know what
ought to be done. Aunt Catherine had a violent fit of hysterics in the
spare bedroom after dinner.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;The engagement is broken off. A great relief. It has been a
lesson for all of us.</p>

<h2>THE EDUCATION OF HUSBANDS</h2>
<p><img class="dropimg" src="images/i_177.png" alt="H" width="20%" />
<span class="hide">H</span>ow suggestive is the new year of bills; and bills of housekeeping. It
is fearful to reflect how many persons rush into matrimony, totally
unprepared for the awful change that awaits them. A man may take a wife
at twenty-one, before he knows the difference between a chip and a
Leghorn! We would no more grant a marriage licence to anybody simply
because he is of age, than a licence, on that ground only, to practise
as an apothecary. Husbands ought to be educated. We should like to have
the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span> questions put to young and inexperienced "Persons about
to Marry:"&mdash;</p>

<p>Are you aware, sir, of the price of coals and candles?</p>

<p>Do you know which is more economical, the aitch-bone, or the round?</p>

<p>How far, young man, will a leg of mutton go in a small family?</p>

<p>How much dearer, now, is silver than Britannia?</p>

<p>Please to give the average price of a four-poster.</p>

<p>Declare, if you can, rash youth, the sum, per annum, that chemisettes,
pelerines, cardinals, bonnets, veils, caps, ribbons, flowers, gloves,
cuffs, and collars, would probably come to in the lump.</p>

<p>If unable to answer these inquiries, we would say to him, "Go back to
school."</p>

<p>He that would be a husband should also undergo a training, physical and
moral. He should be further examined thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Can you read or write amid the yells of a nursery?</p>

<p>Can you wait any given time for breakfast?</p>

<p>Can you maintain your serenity during a washing-day?</p>

<p>Can you cut your old friends?</p>

<p>Can you stand being contradicted in the face of all reason?</p>

<p>Can you keep your temper when you are not listened to?</p>

<p>Can you do what you are told without being told why?</p>

<p>In a word, young sir, have you the patience of Job?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>If you can lay your hand upon your heart and answer "Yes," take your
licence and marry&mdash;not else.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="smcap">To Policemen about to Marry</span>.&mdash;When you are about to marry, visit as many
cooks as you can, so as to give you the widest possible area for your
choice. Avoid housemaids, whose occupation does not admit of the
accumulation of much dust to come down with; and remember that there is
nothing like kitchen-stuff for greasing the wheel of fortune. When
married, a policeman will be justified in living above his station&mdash;if
he can get a room there for nothing.</p>

<h2>WHOM NOT TO MARRY:</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Or, Diogenes the Younger</i></p>

<p><i>The Lady with a Mission.</i>&mdash;She will fill your house with parsons or
professors, lecture you on her pet hobby when she can get no other
audience (which will be pretty often), consider all your old friends
frivolous, and treat you with supreme contempt if you venture to hint
that you like your dinner punctually, and properly cooked.</p>

<p><i>The Lady of Fashion.</i>&mdash;She will regard you as an appendage, a
cheque-drawing animal, a useful purveyor of equipages and dresses and
diamonds and lace, a person to be ignored as much as possible in
Society.</p>

<p><i>The Millionaire's Daughter.</i>&mdash;She will persistently make you aware that
it is <i>her</i> house you live in, <i>her</i> carriage you drive, that the
servants are <i>hers</i>, the dinners <i>hers</i>&mdash;that, in fact, she has bought
you, and given for you much more than you are really worth.</p>

<p><i>The Pious-Parochial Lady.</i>&mdash;She will devote all her time to the
distribution of tracts, the inspection of cottages, the collection of
gossip, and interviews with the curate. Each curate will be a more
"blessed" man than his predecessor, especially if he have the shifty
eyes, aggressive teeth, narrow forehead, and shambling knees which
modern curatism has developed.</p>

<p><i>The Female Novelist.</i> She will sit up all night writing improprieties,
and pass all day in town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> worrying publishers, who are at present sad
victims of the irrepressible petticoat.</p>

<p><i>The Horsey Woman.</i> She will laugh at you as a muff if you don't ride
across country, buy "screws" from her particular friends that you will
have to sell for as many tens as she gave hundreds, and cost you a
fortune in doctors' bills by breaking her collar-bone at least once
every season.</p>

<p><i>The Gushing Female.</i> She will devour you with kisses, to the injury of
your shirt-front, or weep on your bosom, with much the same result. To
her either is equally delightful.</p>

<p><i>The Widow.</i> Diogenes pauses. The theme is too great for him. <i>Vide Mr.
Weller, sen.</i>, in <i>Pickwick, passim.</i></p>
